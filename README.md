MSc Computer Science. Natural Language Processing. Sentiment Analysis 

To evaluate my code on additional data, the file locations of testsets should be entered into the list “filenames”. Then, the whole notebook should be run, with the results being output in the final two cells.

I also use evaluation.py from skeleton. 

Additional files negative-words.txt, positive-words, bad-words are added to the folder.
